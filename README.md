1.2 Vite.js (Build Tool)
 Why Vite?
• Faster build and development server compared to Webpack.
• Supports ES modules and hot module replacement (HMR).
 Key Features in Your Project:
• Instant server startup with npm run dev.
• Optimized production builds using npm run build.

1.3 React Router (v7.1.1)
 Why React Router?
• Manages client-side routing efficiently.
• Enables nested and protected routes.
 Key Features in Your Project:
• / → Home page
• /products → Product listings
• /cart → Shopping cart
• /checkout → Payment processing
• /admin → Admin dashboard
• /login & /register → Authentication pages
• /error → Custom error page

1.4 UI/Styling Libraries
Material-UI (MUI v6.3.1)
 Why MUI?
• Provides pre-built responsive UI components (buttons, cards, modals).
• Theming system for consistent styling.
• Reduces UI development time.
 Usage in Your Project:
• Navigation Bar → AppBar, Toolbar, Typography
• Forms & Inputs → TextField, Button, Select, Checkbox
• Product Cards → Card, Grid, Paper
• Dialog Boxes & Modals → Dialog, Modal

Tailwind CSS
 Why Tailwind?
• Utility-first CSS framework for faster styling.
• No need to write custom CSS files.
• Responsive by default (sm:, md:, lg: classes).
 Usage in Your Project:
• Grid layouts for product pages.
• Responsive buttons with hover effects.
• Animations & transitions (animate-bounce, transition-all).

Framer Motion
 Why Framer Motion?
• Smooth animations without performance lag.
• Simplifies animations using props.
 Usage in Your Project:
• Fade-in effects for pages (initial, animate, exit).
• Hover & tap effects on buttons and product cards.
• Page transitions between routes.

React Icons
 Why React Icons?
• Provides icons from multiple libraries (FontAwesome, Material Icons).
